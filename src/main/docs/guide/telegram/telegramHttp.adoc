If you want to configure one endpoint as the Telegram chatbot webhook while using a runtime such as Netty or Servlet, you can include the following dependency:

dependency:mironaut-chatbots-telegram-http[groupId=io.micronaut.chatbots]

You can configure the path with:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.chatbots.telegram.http.TelegramControllerConfiguration.adoc[]
