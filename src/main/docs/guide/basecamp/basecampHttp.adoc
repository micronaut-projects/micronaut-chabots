If you want to configure one endpoint as the Basecamp chatbot webhook while using a runtime such as Netty or Servlet, you can include the following dependency:

dependency:micronaut-chatbots-basecamp-http[groupId=io.micronaut.chatbots]

You can configure the path with:

include::{includedir}configurationProperties/io.micronaut.chatbots.basecamp.http.BasecampControllerConfiguration.adoc[]
