Chatbot handlers have order, and the first handler to support a command is the one used.

To change the order of handlers, you can override the `getOrder` method in your handler.

snippet::io.micronaut.chatbots.basecamp.UnknownCommandHandler[tags=class]

<1> This handler will handle any message.
<2> Ensure this handler is last in the list of handlers.
