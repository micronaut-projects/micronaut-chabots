This section documents breaking changes between Micronaut Chatbots versions:

=== Micronaut Chatbots 2.0.0

==== Deprecations

- The private class field `io.micronaut.chatbots.google.api.Space.type` deprecated previously has been removed.
As a consequence the corresponding accessor/mutator methods `getType()` and `setType(Type)` have also been removed,
even though they were not deprecated explicitly.
Use the accessor/mutator methods for `singleUserBotDm` or `spaceType` (developer preview) instead.
